# Authentication & Authorization

Claworc uses username/password authentication with optional passkey (WebAuthn) support. All API endpoints except `/health` require authentication.

Optionally, Claworc can sit behind **Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)** and authenticate users from Cloudflare's verified identity headers instead of the built-in login. See [Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)](#cloudflare-access-zero-trust).

## First-Time Setup

When Claworc starts with no users in the database, it enters **setup mode**. The first time you open the dashboard, you will see a "Create Admin Account" form instead of the login page. This creates the initial admin user.

Alternatively, you can create the admin user via CLI:

```bash
# Docker
docker exec claworc-dashboard /app/claworc --create-admin --username admin --password <password>

# Kubernetes
kubectl exec deploy/claworc -n claworc -- /app/claworc --create-admin --username admin --password <password>
```

## Roles

There are two roles: **admin** and **user**. The `user` role additionally has a per-user **Can create instances** flag that grants self-service instance creation and backup restore.

| Capability | Admin | User | User w/ "Can create instances" |
|---|---|---|---|
| View instances | All | Assigned only | Assigned only |
| Start / stop / restart instances | All | Assigned only | Assigned only |
| Access instance chat, terminal, VNC, files, logs, config | All | Assigned only | Assigned only |
| Create / list / download / delete backups | All instances | Assigned only | Assigned only |
| Manage backup schedules | All | Schedules whose instances are all assigned | Schedules whose instances are all assigned |
| Create instances (creator auto-assigned to the new instance) | Yes | No | Yes |
| Restore from backup | Yes | No | Yes (assigned target only) |
| Delete instances | Yes | No | No |
| Manage settings | Yes | No | No |
| Manage users | Yes | No | No |
| Register passkeys | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## User Management

Admins can manage users from the **Users** page in the dashboard:

- **Create User** — set username, password, role (admin or user), and (for the "user" role) the **Can create instances** flag.
- **Delete User** — removes the user and invalidates their sessions.
- **Change Role** — promote a user to admin or demote to user.
- **Toggle Can-create-instances** — grant or revoke self-service instance creation and backup restore for a non-admin user.
- **Reset Password** — set a new password and invalidate all sessions for that user.
- **Assign Instances** — for users with the "user" role, assign which instances they can access. New instances created by a user with **Can create instances** are auto-assigned to the creator.

## Instance Assignment

Users with the "user" role can only see and interact with instances that an admin has explicitly assigned to them. Admins always have access to all instances.

To assign instances to a user, go to **Users**, and use the instance assignment feature for the target user.

## Sessions

- Sessions are stored **in-memory** using HTTP-only cookies.
- Sessions expire after **1 hour**.
- On server restart, all sessions are cleared — users must re-login.
- WebSocket connections (chat, terminal, VNC) authenticate automatically via the session cookie.

## Passkeys (WebAuthn)

Passkeys provide passwordless login using biometric or hardware security keys.

### Registering a Passkey

1. Log in with your username and password.
2. Register a passkey from your account (the browser will prompt for biometric or security key).
3. Give the passkey a name for identification.

### Logging in with a Passkey

1. On the login page, click **"Sign in with Passkey"**.
2. Follow the browser prompt to authenticate with your registered passkey.

### Managing Passkeys

- View your registered passkeys from the WebAuthn credentials endpoint.
- Delete passkeys you no longer use.

## Password Reset

### Via Admin UI

An admin can reset any user's password from the **Users** page. This immediately invalidates all sessions for that user.

### Via CLI

Use the included `reset-password.sh` script:

```bash
./reset-password.sh
```

The script auto-detects your deployment mode (Docker or Kubernetes) and prompts for username and new password.

You can also run the command directly:

```bash
# Docker
docker exec claworc-dashboard /app/claworc --reset-password --username <user> --password <new-password>

# Kubernetes
kubectl exec deploy/claworc -n claworc -- /app/claworc --reset-password --username <user> --password <new-password>
```

Note: CLI password reset cannot invalidate in-memory sessions. Existing sessions will expire naturally within 1 hour. For immediate invalidation, use the admin UI.

## Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)

When Claworc runs behind [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/), Cloudflare authenticates users at the edge and injects a signed JWT (`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`) on every request. Enable `CLAWORC_CF_ACCESS_ENABLED` to have Claworc trust that identity instead of its built-in login.

How it works:

- **JWT verification.** Claworc verifies the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` token against your team's JWKS (`<team-domain>/cdn-cgi/access/certs`), checking the signature (RS256 only), the `aud` (your Access application's AUD tag), the issuer, and expiry. The plaintext `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header is **not** trusted — only the verified `email` claim is used.
- **Match existing accounts only.** The verified email is matched against an existing Claworc user's email. There is **no auto-provisioning**: an unknown email is rejected with `403`. Set each user's email on the **Users** page (or via the CLI for the first admin).
- **Replaces built-in login.** While enabled, the username/password and passkey login endpoints and the first-run setup flow are disabled (`403`). The dashboard shows a "Sign in via Cloudflare Access" notice instead of a login form.
- **Stateless, per-request.** Each request is verified from its JWT; Claworc does not issue its own session cookie in this mode. Revoke access by removing the user from your Cloudflare Access policy or deleting the Claworc user.
- **Logout.** The dashboard's logout redirects to Cloudflare's `/cdn-cgi/access/logout` so the Access session itself ends.

`CLAWORC_CF_ACCESS_ENABLED` and `CLAWORC_AUTH_DISABLED` are mutually exclusive; setting both is a startup error.

### Bootstrap order

Because the built-in login/setup is disabled in this mode, create the first admin (with an email) **before** enabling Cloudflare Access:

```bash
# Docker
docker exec claworc-dashboard /app/claworc --create-admin \
  --username admin --password <password> --email admin@example.com
```

Then set `CLAWORC_CF_ACCESS_ENABLED=true` (plus the team domain and AUD below) and restart. The `--email` flag also works on an existing admin to backfill their email.

## Configuration

The following environment variables configure authentication behavior:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAWORC_RP_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:8000` | WebAuthn relying party origins (your dashboard URL). Comma-separated for multiple values. |
| `CLAWORC_RP_ID` | `localhost` | WebAuthn relying party ID (your domain name) |
| `CLAWORC_CF_ACCESS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust) header authentication. Replaces the built-in login. |
| `CLAWORC_CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` | _(empty)_ | Your Cloudflare Access team domain, e.g. `https://myteam.cloudflareaccess.com`. Required when CF Access is enabled. |
| `CLAWORC_CF_ACCESS_AUD` | _(empty)_ | The Access application's AUD tag. Required when CF Access is enabled. |

For production deployments, set these to match your actual domain:

```bash
CLAWORC_RP_ORIGINS=https://claworc.example.com
CLAWORC_RP_ID=claworc.example.com
```
